Test Suite
==========

These tests are browser-based tests, using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer) to simulate user interaction with the [educ.io](https://educ.io) site and web-apps.

This testing is essential to ensure that code releases are high-quality, and do not introduce bugs or functionality impairments into the system.
